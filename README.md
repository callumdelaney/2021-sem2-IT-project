# Stack and technologies being used:

# Licenses used:

https://barzamsr.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PD/pages/35291137/License+Agreement

# How to run our application:
Currently Heroku builds it, but if you want to run it manually, open the project up to the directory "2021-sem2-IT-project", command the terminal to "npm install" (install all dependencies), then "npm run build". once it's done, command "npm start". Once the terminal has written the message of :

"Server listening on 3001
connection to MongoDB on cluster0-shard-00-01.uxvwm.mongodb.net:undefined
Success"

navigate to localhost:3001.
